1. Open the Part3.java file. You will be creating a program that has the same functionality (does the same thing) as you're current code in Main.java, but with methods!

NOTE: Everything declared outside of a method (in the general class) must start with static (i.e., static String, static int, static void myMethod(), etc.). We will explain why later.

2. Declare the same variables you have in Main.java, this time declaring them in the class instead of a method.

3. Create the following methods that return the new value: 
  A) a method that adds to the current balance
  B) a method that appends to the current name
  C) a method that increments the ID. 
  
Remember, these methods should take a new value as a parameter, set the current value to the new value, and return the new value. 

4. Create the following methods that don't return a value: 
  A) a method that uses the conditional you created 
  B) a method that prints the print statement that you have. 

5. Create the main method. Remember, it must be created in a specific way. 

6. Do the following in the main method:
  A) Print the initial details
  B) Add 240.40 to the account balance and print the following: "You're new balance is {balance}"
  C) Append a last name to the account name and print the following: "You're new account name is {accountName}"
  D) Increment the ID by 1 and print the following: "You're new account ID is {id}"
  E) Print the new details
  F) Print the status of your money (the conditional)
